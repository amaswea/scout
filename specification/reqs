# Requirements
1. Accept JSON file that specifies the content pieces
2. Generate layout alternatives that satisfy those constraints
3. Output SVG for each
4. Display SVG in the web page

Files for each SVG? 
A Layout specification for the hardcoded elements

What are we generating? 

# Generating all possible layouts
# Non-overlapping constraint by default? 
# Need to know how large the components are going to be
# Should restrict positions to be along some kind of grid otherwise the search space is endless
# Should specify that shapes cannot overlap
# Constraint solver
#  - only returns one solution at a time
#  - need to add a cconstraint to prevent the values of the model from happening again
#  - How to rank the solutions? 
#  - optimize a cost function possibly
