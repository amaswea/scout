Things to do 
- The same elements across canvases should probably be linked somehow so that the menu items show up consistently in the right state for the same element
 - Make sure UNDO is actually undoing because the results don't look right
- Should probably do at least one other constraint type next to check the framework will work for different types of constraints

OTHER
- multiple menus opening at a time
